Title: About
Slug: About

My name is Jean-Luc Stevens. I'm currently a computational
neuroscience PhD student at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. I
am part of the [Doctoral Training
Centre](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/) and my supervisor is [James
Bednar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/).

My primary research interest is in how computational models may be
used to understand the principles underlying cortical intelligence and
my thesis aims to achieve better understand the temporal dynamics of
activity response over large area of the primary visual cortex (V1).

Most of my coding work is in Python and I have been working in Python
for around 15 years. I am the author of two open-source projects aimed
at making high-quality, reproducible science possible with in the
[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html):
[Lancet](http://ioam.github.io/lancet/) for declaratively launching
large numbers of batch jobs and
[HoloViews](http://ioam.github.io/holoviews/) which makes exploratory,
reproducible analysis easy and fun!
