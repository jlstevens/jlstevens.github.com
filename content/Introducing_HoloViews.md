In this initial post, I introduce HoloViews by building our new logo
in the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). We will
explore the famous Mandelbrot set along the way.

You may download the notebook for yourself [here](https://github.com/jlstevens/website-notebooks/blob/master/Introducing_HoloViews.ipynb).
